<p>I'm a Data Scientist, and currently committing to an MSc. in Applied Data Science. In my repositories, you'd see various projects I personally developed. I also deploy some of my projects on Streamlit.</p>

## Repository

Here are a few notable projects I have worked on:
- [LLM-Robofund](https://github.com/dfavenfre/LLM-Robofund): an LLM Chatbot, which is currently being built on Streamlit that scopes investors to gain better insigths when making investment decision. Informative Robofund allows investors to chat with KAP documents, and with various data scraped from TEFAS platform.

- [Guide To Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/dfavenfre/Guide-To-Deep-Neural-Networks-): This repository serves as your ultimate resource hub for comprehensive guides and tutorials on neural network development. Whether you're a novice or a seasoned practitioner, you'll discover valuable insights and practical tips to navigate the complex world of neural networks.

- [Bank Customer Deposit Prediction](https://github.com/dfavenfre/customer_deposit_classifier): Deployed a Streamlit app to predict bank customer deposit subscription behavior by developing and finetuning an XGBClassifier model.

- [Forecasting Hourly Electricity Prices](https://github.com/dfavenfre/electricity-price-forecasting): Developed various predictive models, including a hand-crafted neural network (LSTM) model for linear prediction tasks and an XGB regression model.

- [Econ Dashboard](https://github.com/dfavenfre/Econ-Dashboard): Created a centralized financial dashboard for screening financial/economic data, sentiment classification, and time-series forecasting. This all-in-one dashboard is equipped with hand-crafted neural network
models, including a sentiment classifier with pre-trained embeddings, and LSTM forecast models for different market capitalizations.

- [Financial Sentiment Classifier](https://github.com/dfavenfre/financial-sentiment-classifier): Developed an NLP model to analyze the sentiment of financial or economic commentary, tweet, or news. It is built upon Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) embedding layer and is fine-tuned for financial sentiment classification purposes. Financial Phrasebank's 'agreeall' dataset was used for fine-tuning.


## Medium Blogs
I occasionally write blog posts on various topics at [Medium](https://medium.com/@bauglir). Here are some of my recent articles:

- [Leveraging Lagged Exogenous Variables For Time-Series Forecasting â€” Without Time](https://medium.com/@bauglir/leveraging-lagged-exogenous-variables-for-time-series-forecasting-without-time-472f14acb488)
  I explore additional usage of ML models to forecast (t+n) horizons with lagged exogenous variables. On top of that, I deploy a neural network time-series model to create a benchmark for later comparison, using nn.LSTM layers.

- [House Price Prediction: Stochastic Gradient Boosting With KNN Imputer for Pre-processing](https://medium.com/@bauglir/house-price-prediction-stochastic-gradient-boosting-w-knn-imputer-pre-processing-f3d1651caa00):
  A depth-analysis on Kaggle's House price prediction competition, along with my submission. Within this medium blog, I explore the usage of KNNImputer for missing value imputations, engineer some features, build a model using Stochastic Gradient Boost, conduct hyperparameter tuning deploying Optuna and finaly, I evaluate feature selection based on SHAP algorithm.
       
- [Credit Score Prediction With Multi-Model Ensemble Voting Classifier](https://medium.com/@bauglir/credit-score-prediction-with-multi-model-ensemble-voting-classifier-80-accuracy-b091f929ad40)
  I share a detailed-out process starting from cleaning and interpolating to building a voting-classifier as an introduction to building a classification model, using various machine learning algorithms.
