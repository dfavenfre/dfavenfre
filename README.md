<p>I'm a Junior Data Scientist, and currently committing to an MSc. in Applied Data Science. In my repositories, you'd see various projects I personally developed. I also deploy some of my projects on Streamlit.</p>

## My Projects

Here are a few notable projects I have worked on:

- [Bank Customer Deposit Prediction](https://github.com/dfavenfre/customer_deposit_classifier): Streamlit app developed for bank customer deposit prediction, using a fine-tuned XGBClassifier model.
- [Forecasting Hourly Electricity Prices](https://github.com/dfavenfre/electricity-price-forecasting): Developed various models to forecast hourly electricity prices provided by the EXIST Market Transparency Platform.
- [Econ Dashboard](https://github.com/dfavenfre/Econ-Dashboard): Econ-Dashboard is a centralized financial dashboard for financial/economic data screening, sentiment classification and time-series forecasting
- [Financial Sentiment Classifier](https://github.com/dfavenfre/financial-sentiment-classifier): Model_USE is a pre-trained NLP model to analyze the sentiment of financial or economic commentary, tweet, or news. It is built upon Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) and fine-tuned for financial sentiment classification purposes. Financial Phrasebank's 'agreeall' dataset was used for fine-tuning.

## Medium Blogs
I occasionally write blog posts on various topics at [Medium](https://medium.com/@bauglir). Here are some of my recent articles:

- [Leveraging Lagged Exogenous Variables For Time-Series Forecasting â€” Without Time](https://medium.com/@bauglir/leveraging-lagged-exogenous-variables-for-time-series-forecasting-without-time-472f14acb488)
  I explore additional usage of ML models to forecast (t+n) horizons with lagged exogenous variables. On top of that, I deploy a neural network time-series model to create a benchmark for later comparison, using nn.LSTM layers.

- [House Price Prediction: Stochastic Gradient Boosting With KNN Imputer for Pre-processing](https://medium.com/@bauglir/house-price-prediction-stochastic-gradient-boosting-w-knn-imputer-pre-processing-f3d1651caa00):
  A depth-analysis on Kaggle's House price prediction competition, along with my submission. Within this medium blog, I explore the usage of KNNImputer for missing value imputations, engineer some features, build a model using Stochastic Gradient Boost, conduct hyperparameter tuning deploying Optuna and finaly, I evaluate feature selection based on SHAP algorithm.
       
- [Credit Score Prediction With Multi-Model Ensemble Voting Classifier](https://medium.com/@bauglir/credit-score-prediction-with-multi-model-ensemble-voting-classifier-80-accuracy-b091f929ad40)
  I share a detailed-out process starting from cleaning and interpolating to building a voting-classifier as an introduction to building a classification model, using various machine learning algorithms.
